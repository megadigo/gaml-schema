  STEPS:
  - Delete the previous code and create a new implementation from scratch
  - Create the game using this GAML specification.
  - The game must be immediately playable without any setup or compilation.

  METADATA:
  - The description of this file is provided by a meta file mention in the schema property. 
  - The meta file in a network location accessible to the AI in a github project. 
  - The meta file should be used to generate the game as specified and to understand the requirements.

  STRUCTURE: 
  - HTML with canvas element (id="game-canvas")
  - Show credits on main menu
  - CSS for styling and layout
  - All colors, positions, and sizes must match specification exactly
  - JavaScript game implementation with proper game loop
  - Use sprite sheet for all graphics
  - Game loop using requestAnimationFrame()
  - Keyboard event listeners MUST be set up in a function called at the END of the script
  - Game state management (menu/howToPlay/playing/levelUp/victory/gameOver)
  - Audio management (background music/sound effects)
  - Set up keyboard event listeners AFTER all functions are defined to avoid reference errors
  - Add preventDefault() for all game control keys to prevent default browser behaviors

  IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIREMENTS:
  - Ensure all game states transition correctly based on user input and game events
  - Ensure procedural dungeon generation works as specified
  - Ensure player movement and collision detection function correctly
  - Ensure combat mechanics (attacking, enemy AI, health management) function correctly
  - Ensure loot system (gold drops, item pickups, chest interactions) function correctly
  - Ensure level progression and difficulty scaling function correctly

  FIX:
